# Where's Waldo?

This is a classical "Where's Waldo" game, however it does not contain other characters. The user is able to find three characters, upload his time taken to find them and compare his time to highscores from other players.

- If the player doesn't find all characters after 24 hours, the timer resets to `00:00:00` because the milliseconds passed are converted to a date object and it's day is stripped out later to only receive the time. A solution to this is shown in [this answer on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67256291).
- Data is written to the database from the clients browser, this makes it very easy to create manipulated highscores. However, the clients permissions prevents him from deleting/editing highscores.
