## :exclamation: Known Issues

- If the player doesn't find all characters after 24 hours, the timer resets to `00:00:00` because the milliseconds passed are converted to a date object and it's day is stripped out later to only receive the time. A solution to this is shown in [this answer on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67256291).
- Data is written to the database from the clients browser, this makes it very easy to create manipulated highscores. However, the clients permissions prevents him from deleting/editing highscores.
- When deploying with the Firebase GitHub Action for Deployment, Firebase does not respect the configuration files. Make sure to change them manually or deploy with `firebase deploy`!
